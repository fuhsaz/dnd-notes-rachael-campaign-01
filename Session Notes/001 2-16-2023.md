	- Elizabeth felt a little magic tingle when she agreed to bring it back
- Killed a [[Giant Toad]]
	- It swallowed [[Enna Nightwhisper]]
- Got to [[Tinklebottom]], a forest town of gnomes
	- [[Kipper Kaleidoscope]] owns the [[Gadget Emporium]] 
- Went to the [[Gadget Emporium]] just before closing
	- [[Haw Mossfoot]] bought a mechanical bird
	- I saw some wands, but they only shot illusory sparks
- Then we went to the [[Gigglewater Inn]], owned by a tiny half gnome half tabaxi named [[Pippin Playfulpaws]]

- Went to the [[Prankster's Den]]
	- [[Hildegard Hopsalot]]
	- Wasn't a store, just a place to hang out and talk about pranks they'd pulled
- Went back to [[Gadget Emporium]]
	- He says the necklace "demands to be worn", but "the price is too high"
	- Wrote us a riddle about it
	- He wants us to take the necklace, but says it might be difficult
	- [[Elliejobel Folkrun]] is the only person who can handle it, apparently
	- I'm going to drop my flower codpiece on the way out, as an excuse to go back, and buy some prank gear

### Necklace Riddle
On a bed of stone, etched with care,
A riddle waits for those who dare
To seek the garden of mirth and play,
Where laughter flows both night and day.

Beyond the gate, beyond the wall,
Lies a place where giggles call.
Listen close and you will hear
The sound of joy, the sound of fear.

Follow the path of winding vines
And step between the ivy lines.
Through the arch of blooming flowers
Lies the garden of happy hours.

Where fountains sing and laugher rings,
And the scent of joy forever clings.
In the Giggle Water Garden you'll find
Happiness and mind unwind.
