- Gnome Elliejobel Folkrun who wants to be a mayor asked us to get a magic necklace back from her friend Kipper Kaleidoscope, lives in Tinklebottom (lol)
	- Seemed very desperate to have it back
	- Elizabeth felt a little magic tingle when she agreed to bring it back
- Killed a big toad, it ate Elizabeth
- Got to Tinkebottom, a forest town of gnomes
	- Kipper owns the Gadget Emporium 
- Went to the Gadget Emporium just before closing
	- Haw bought a mechanical bird
	- I saw some wands, but they only shot illusory sparks
- Then we went to the Gigglewater Inn, owned by a tiny half gnome half tabaxi named Pippin Playfulpaws 
- Enna is from Dusk, Haw is from Pitman, Gerik is from Cumberland
- Francis Featherwing - an Aarakockra I met in the pub
	- Going to study under Professor Bramblebutt at the Duskite research academy
	- pranked him with a table of gnomes
- Went to the prankster's den
	- Hildegard Hopsalot
	- Wasn't a store, just a place to hang out and talk about pranks they'd pulled
- Went back to Gadget Emporium
	- He says the necklace "demands to be worn", but "the price is too high"
	- Wrote us a riddle about it
	- He wants us to take the necklace, but says it might be difficult
	- Ellie is the only person who can handle it, apparently
	- I'm going to drop my flower codpiece on the way out, as an excuse to go back, and buy some prank gear
