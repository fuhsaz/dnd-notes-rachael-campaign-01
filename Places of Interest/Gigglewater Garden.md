## Notes
- First heard about this place in a riddle from [[Kipper Kaleidoscope]]:
	On a bed of stone, etched with care,
	A riddle waits for those who dare
	To seek the garden of mirth and play,
	Where laughter flows both night and day.

	Beyond the gate, beyond the wall,
	Lies a place where giggles call.
	Listen close and you will hear
	The sound of joy, the sound of fear.

	Follow the path of winding vines
	And step between the ivy lines.
	Through the arch of blooming flowers
	Lies the garden of happy hours.

	Where fountains sing and laugher rings,
	And the scent of joy forever clings.
	In the Giggle Water Garden you'll find
	Happiness and mind unwind.
