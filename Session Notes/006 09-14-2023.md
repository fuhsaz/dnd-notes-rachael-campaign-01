## Session Notes
- We had some time to kill before going to Liora's house, so we went to the old side of campus to hang out
- Found a library and read some books about magical items, cursed items, and vampires
- Gerik found a neat book about swords
- We went to her house, and her human husband answered the door
- We had a delish meal!
- After dinner, we get the necklace out to look at it.
- Liora says the necklace is like trying to convince Haw to attune to it
- She put the pendant in a lead box, and said that we need a few magical items from the school, that we need to go get, or it will take too long
- It's in a storehouse in the Paladin section of the school, we'll try to sneak in tomorrow
- Bed Time!
- Haw resisted the necklace when he woke up. Yay!
