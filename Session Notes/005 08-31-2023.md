- About the research academy
	- If your magic is of a divine nature, you might go to the Gorian Seminary
	- The academy studies all types of magic
	- Very hoity-toity, everyone who's anyone sends at least one child there
- On our way to the academy, a suspiciously massive flock of crows flew over our heads.
	- They weren't celestial, fiend, or fey though
- We got to the academy and looked around for possible leads
	- Gerik went to the student office and got a list of professors
	- Enna and Cloud went to some stoner druids
		- Got the names of some professors Eladril, Thorn, Spellbinder
- Reading the courselist
	- Shielding with Sorcerous Might - Lira 
	- Wards and Runes: the foundation of magical defense - Liora Tomekeeper (half elf)
	- Divine Protection and Wardings - Sir Cedrick Lightshield
- We went to Liora's class
	- It was mad boring, but Gerik and Haw did alright through it
	- Afterward we talked to her and convinced her to take a look at our item in private
	- She showed us that taking the necklace away actually hurt Haw
	- She said we could come by her house this evening and stay there overnight while she attempts to remove the curse
