## Description
- Snooty Aarakocra man
## Location
**Past:** 
**Current:** [[Tinklebottom]]
## Story Points
- Has earned a fellowship at the [[Duskite Research Academy]] and is going there to study under [[Professor Bramblebutt]]
- He said that [[Gerik Stormbreak]] could call on him if we're ever in the area
- But then we pranked him with some gnomes by tying his feet to the table. So perhaps he won't be happy to see us, if he knew that it was us
