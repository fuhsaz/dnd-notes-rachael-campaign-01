## Session Notes
- Come down the stairs post-plant fight and see a big room with more of the glowing rocks, but no plants
	- Curtain of vines on the far wall
	- Mushroom patch where the glowing rocks meet the inner wall
	- Behind the vines we found 3 healing potions and a Whip of Warning
	- And we found a small glowing stone!
- We went through a narrow, bug-filled passage. When we came out, a big bug was on Cloud's back, so Gerik smushed it. It went everywhere.
- In the next big room, Gerik found a treasure chest, and in it was an unlabeled potion
- Next we came to the biggest room yet, with a tree between two pools of water. As we walked past it, it swatted Gerik. We turned around, and Gerik convinced it we meant no harm. He told us about this nutty gnome at the bottom, and gave us a magic acorn that we can smash to create an ent helper for 2 turns!
- We came down into the final room to find a spooky gnome sitting in the dark. He's got the pendant on and won't give it back.
- We whomped him
