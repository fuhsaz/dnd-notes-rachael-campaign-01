## Description
- A gnome woman
## Location
**Past:** [[Tinklebottom]]
**Current:** [[Harrison]]
## Story Points
- Met her after saving [[Harrison]] from the [[False Hydra]]
- She wants to be the next mayor of the town, because the former one was eaten
- She asked us to get a necklace back for her from her friend [[Kipper Kaleidoscope]], who lives in [[Tinklebottom]], the gnome settlement where she's from.
	- She seemed _extremely_ desperate to have it back
	- [[Enna Nightwhisper]] personally made the agreement with her to retrieve the necklace, and felt a little magical tingle upon shaking her hand
## Notes
- She gave Gerik a nice set of crocheted platemail that he's hoping will become soaked with blood and turn his armor a cool shade of red.
